# Overview
This repository is used for tracking hand-manipulated objects

# quickstart
I'll get back to you on this one, sort of forgot how everything works
Make sure you initialize all of the submodules with git submodules init or something like that

# TODOs
* Track objects in the hand better, probably by finally doing icp
* Attempt to use the keypoints from openpose, by specifying the location of the hands with the results of the detector
* try Kitani's hand detector to better localize the part of the hand we care about
* Document the finger detector
* Automatically specify the location of the hands with the output of Mask R-CNN probably
